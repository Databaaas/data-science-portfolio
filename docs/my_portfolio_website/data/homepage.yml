    <p class="lead">
    I am a dedicated <strong>medical doctor</strong> and multidisciplinary <strong>data scientist</strong> with a passion for leveraging data to improve healthcare outcomes. 
    My focus lies in the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and explainable AI (XAI) to enhance the prediction and management of various medical conditions,
    including infectious diseases and chronic conditions. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="lead">
    My work spans collecting and analysing health data, developing predictive models, and creating user-friendly dashboards for both patients and healthcare professionals.
    </p>
    
    <p class="lead">
    Beyond my medical background, I possess biostatistics and data science skills, using tools like Python, R, Stata and SQL.
    I have a proven track record in data-driven health initiatives like monitoring ferritin levels in
    blood donors and optimizing blood donation procedures through operational surveys.
